  ✓ npm 9+ (check: npm --version)
  ✓ Git 2.0+ (check: git --version)
  ✓ 2GB+ free disk space
  ✓ Internet connection (for remote repo cloning)

1.2 CLONE THE REPOSITORY
  $ git clone https://github.com/your-org/RepoArchitectAgent
  $ cd RepoArchitectAgent

1.3 INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
  $ cd web
  $ npm install --legacy-peer-deps
  $ cd ..

1.4 OPTIONAL: API KEYS (Not Required for Testing)
  If testing AI features, create web/.env.local with:
